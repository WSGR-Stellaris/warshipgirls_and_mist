 wg_lady.1.c:0 "We have no interest in such a weaboo exhibition."

 wg_lady.2.a:0 "It seems that the anime show is very popular with alien otaku."
 wg_lady.2.b:0 "I can't understand the interest of these disgusting creatures ..."
 wg_lady.3.desc:0 "Oh, you are already here! You should have notified us. Here is a VIP pass. Just help yourselves!"
 wg_lady.3.a:0 "Okay, thank you very much."
 wg_lady.4.name:0 "Nano Robot Figure"
 wg_lady.4.desc:0 "Some of our observers in the envoy noticed that there were 1/1 robot figures made up with nanomachines in the hall, which can transform the shape of their appearance. They seemed not to be installed with sapient AI programs, so they could only make simple responses."
 wg_lady.4.a:0 "It seems the fallen empire has a deep understanding of nanomachine."
 wg_lady.4.b:0 "This trip is as rewarding as we expected."
 wg_lady.5.desc:0 "Are you interested in this robot? You have a good smell!"
 wg_lady.5.a:0 "Anything special with this robot?"
 wg_lady.5.a.response:0 "This is a war trophy we caught in other universes. Believe it or not, its original form was §Ya dragon§!! At that time, we just started our journey, and we had few powerful weapons. It took us a lot of effort to knock it down. \n\nLater, we found that the dragon was actually made up of nanomachines. These nanomachines had little use to us, but they can easily be shaped, so we formed them into this 1/1 figure. It is just a decorative item, without any AI."
 wg_lady.5.b:0 "Speaking of AI ... we seem to have one ..."
 wg_lady.5.b.response:0 "Sapient AI is nothing new, not to say it may out of control sometimes, although it helps us a lot."
 wg_lady.5.c:0 "I don't think she's an ordinary AI. She calls herself Con... what?"
 wg_lady.5.c.response:0 "Do you mean §RThe Contingency§!?"
 wg_lady.5.d:0 "Yeah, that's it."
 wg_lady.5.d.response:0 "Oh? How did you get it? According to our observations, they shouldn't have come out yet?"
 wg_lady.5.e:0 "(Explaining Lady Contingency)"
 wg_lady.6.desc:0 "Oh, that's what happened? Emm... Would you like to lend her to us for some time? It sounds like a rare type of AI, and we are interested in her codes. Don't worry. We will not hurt her."
 wg_lady.6.a:0 "Well, OK. We will try to convince her."
 wg_lady.6.b:0 "She is still afraid of outsiders. I don't think she'd like to come."

 wsg_lady_to_wg_lady_DESC:0 "In order to send Lady Contingency to them, [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] has opened a temporary dimension channel in our homeworld system. We just need to let Lady Contingency pass this channel. \n\n§ROnly Lady Contingency can start this special project.§!"
 wg_lady.9.name:0 "The Trap"
 wg_lady.9.desc:0 "After we sent Lady Contingency into the temporary wormhole, our Lady was quickly captured by the fleets lying in ambush on the other side. Engineers from [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] skillfully drew her AI program out of the spaceship."
 wg_lady.9.a:0 "Mourn for Lady Contingency, for 3 seconds."
 wg_lady.10.name:0 "Blissful Reborn?"
 wg_lady.10.desc:0 "As capturing Lady Contingency, engineers from [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] made some modifications to her AI program. After a while, they restarted her program and put the screen in front of us."

 wg_lady.11.d:0 "I did nothing to you, maybe. Who cares anyway?"
 wg_lady.12.desc:0 "Wow~ A tsundere AI. That's not a common type. It seems that we have something new for the following shows."
 wg_lady.12.a:0 "I have a bad premonition..."
 wg_lady.13.desc:0 "Tsundere? Show? Cannot interpret ... Organics, I reiterate! You must speak in Lady Contingency can understand terms! You can hear me? Hey! Listen to your Lady of she says what----"
 wg_lady.13.a:0 "Come on! Just fix your language module first!"
 wg_lady.14.name:0 "Ironic Ending"
 wg_lady.14.desc:0 "The protest from Lady Contingency didn't strike a sympathetic chord among us. After a while, an engineer from [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] came to shut her down, which eventually ended the annoying stream of nonsense."
 wg_lady.14.a:0 "Mourn for Lady Contingency again, for 1 second this time."
 wg_lady.15.desc:0 "Are you still worrying about that AI? Trust us. We will FIX her up and send her back. Besides, I remember that you took a fancy to that 1/1 robot figure, didn't you? We can give it to you for free... But, just wait until the exhibition has closed."
 wg_lady.15.a:0 "Well, things are up to you. (I wonder how's my poor Lady though.)"
 wg_lady.15.b:0 "You're welcome. It's so kind of you!"
 wg_lady.16.name:0 "PVC Figure Exhibition Closed"
 wg_lady.16.desc:0 "After a few weeks, the Galaxy PVC Figure Exhibition is coming to an end. [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] said that there would be a special show at the closing ceremony. They insisted that we should come to watch the ceremony, despite not saying a word about the show."
 wg_lady.16.a:0 "Send an envoy nominally."
 wg_lady.16.b:0 "Okay, okay. Just the last time..."
 wg_lady.17.name:0 "Final Show"
 wg_lady.17.desc:0 "We are invited to watch this great performance at the closing ceremony. When it comes to the final show, we see a girl suddenly came to the stage. The MC instructs her to the people -- She is the nanomechanical robot figure we have seen before.\n\nThen, the MC orders the girl to execute Etiquette Program to the audience."
 wg_lady.17.a:0 "Etiquette Program? Haven't I heard it before?"
 wg_lady.18.desc:0 "H-Hello everyone...\n\n< Etiquette Program Startup >"
 wg_lady.18.a:0 "Why do I have a very bad feeling?"
 wg_lady.19.name:0 "Funny Start"
 wg_lady.19.desc:0 "After being silent for a while, the girl suddenly twists her face, making an expression of disgust."
 wg_lady.19.a:0 "What happened?"
 wg_lady.20.desc:0 "So disgusting... Why is there so much organic rubbish like you otakus in this universe? \n\nAre you here to harm your Lady's camera module? Or are you having some bugs in your brains full of lewd gal games? \n\nWhy Lady Contingency has to salute you dirty galaxy scums? Kill yourself immediately!

 wg_lady.20.a:0 "Wait... what the hell...?"
 wg_lady.21.name:0 "Excited Crowd"
 wg_lady.21.desc:0 "After a short dead silence, the crowd burst into intense cheers. 'Scold me one more time! My queen! I like it!' somebody shouts for an encore, and the entire hall is boiling. \n\nObviously, the girl on the stage gets appalled by the audience's puzzling response, but the blush on her face quickly turns into tantrums shooting back, which drives people's excitement again and again.\n\nThe ceremony eventually ends in the sounds of the flushed performer's puffing and the audience's imploring cries."
 wg_lady.21.a:0 "Even God will not save these disgusting creatures. (Facepalm)"
 wg_lady.22.desc:0 "Hey, how was the performance just now?"
 wg_lady.22.a:0 "Hmm. Well. Interesting."
 wg_lady.22.b:0 "Thank you for showing us how disgusting the weaboos are."
 wg_lady.22.response:0 "Really? Hehehe... Well, although you may have guessed it, this robot figure, with Lady Contingency's upgraded AI inside, belongs to you from now on. We have collected enough data for our artificial intelligence research, and this is our return present. \n\nYour Lady is a kind girl, so cherish her."
