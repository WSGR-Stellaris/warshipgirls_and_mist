 EMPIRE_DESIGN_wg1_desc:0 "Warship Girls was designed by Illumoe Inc.using reverse engineering of Abyssal Fleet's technology. Their purpose is to resist the invasion of the Abyssal Fleet and save human civilization. \n\nAfter a long battle, Warship Girls defeated the Abyssal's last defence line, completely expelled them out of their homeworld. However, the few surviving human beings couldn't deal with the chaos after the Civil War, so Warship Girls took over the world's administration. The remaining people were respected as 'Admirals', who formed an alliance with Warship Girls.\n\nAt the end of the 22nd century, the Alliance discovered the hyperplanes and put the first hyperspace engine into practice. As the hyperspace technology becomes mature, Warship Girls are looking further to the stars."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_sh1:0 "Abyssal Fleet"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_sh1_desc:0 "Abyssal shipgirls were originated from the deep waters in their homeworld, which is the origin of the word 'shipgirl'. The source of their advanced weapons and technologies is still a mystery.\n\nThe human makes their first contact with them when they appear on the surface of the ocean and shows hostility. People later named these shipgirls as "Abyssal Fleet" after losing superiority at sea. \n\nHowever "Abyssal Fleet" made no further attempt after clearing out the resistance on the sea, which grants humans the opportunity for their counter-attack, the development of the shipgirls -- "Warship Girl". The sea has become the warzone between the two shipgirls since then. \n\nIn the end, Abyssal Fleet was defeated and driven out of their homeworld by the Alliance between Warship Girls and human beings, some of the Abyssal shipgirls managed to escape into deep space before their ultimate defeat. \n\nCurrently, they have settled on some other planet and preparing their vengeance."
