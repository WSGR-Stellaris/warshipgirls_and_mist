Additionally, by comparing the records of the star chart, we found that two more galaxies - Ilon and Rabbi - also disappeared. In other words, they stop emitting electromagnetic radiation in a fraction of a second.\n\nOur scientists are unable to explain this phenomenon, and the entire astronomical community is full of uneasiness."
