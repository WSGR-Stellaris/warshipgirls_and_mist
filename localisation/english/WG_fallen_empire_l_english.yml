 wg_fe.2.c:0 "(Communication terminated)"
 01_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "Hello [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], we have just archived the information of your civilization. How many times on earth have we repeated this work? ... Whatever, it seems that THEY are right, really and again."
 02_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "Cherish the present. Cherish where you call it 'home'."
 03_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "Welcome. Would you like to take a relax at Tirpitz Arcade?  It's on the 1453rd floor of our Game Center, my children."

 05_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], my children, you must grow up faster. Perhaps we may have to face what we fear in the near future, for THAT nightmare will definitely catch up with us, again."

 07_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "You said §Ythe Admiral§!? Hmm... It sounds like a high position, but unfortunately, we don't have such a piece of history. Not all shipgirl civilizations share the same origin. You have to understand this point."

 06_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "In the past millions of years, we have witnessed so many times the death of a person, a civilization and even a galaxy. We once kept wandering in the void just for the self-deceiving and short-lived 'peace', but from now on, we will never back down."
 07_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "Never give up hope, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We can definitely survive it."
